# All Your Base

Convert a number, represented as a sequence of digits in one base, to any other base.

Implement general base conversion. Given a number in base **a**,
represented as a sequence of digits, convert it to base **b**.

## Note

- Try to implement the conversion yourself.
  Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.

## About [Positional Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation)

In positional notation, a number in base **b** can be understood as a linear
combination of powers of **b**.

The number 42, *in base 10*, means: `(4 × 10¹) + (2 × 10⁰)`

The number 101010, *in base 2*, means: `(1 × 2⁵) + (0 × 2⁴) + (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (0 × 2⁰)`

The number 1120, *in base 3*, means: `(1 × 3³) + (1 × 3²) + (2 × 3¹) + (0 × 3⁰`

I think you got the idea!

*Yes. Those three numbers above are exactly the same. Congratulations!*
