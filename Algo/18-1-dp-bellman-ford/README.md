# Programming Problem 18-1: Single-Source Shortest Paths

Using Bellman-Ford Algorithms


## Work

  - [This file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/Algo/18-1-dp-bellman-ford/testfiles/tiny_ewdnc.txt) describes an instance of a weighted edge graph. The format of the file is:

  1st line: number of vertices
  following lines: verte(src) vertex(dst),weight vertex(dst),weight ... 

*For example 2nd line is: 1 3,0.26 5,0.38 which means vertex source 1 is linked to vertex 3 with weight 0.26 and vertex 5 with weight 0.38*

*(Answer: negative cycle detected)*
