# Programming Problem 17: Optimal Binary Search Tree (OptBST)

## Work

  - [This file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/Algo/17-dp-opt-bst/testfiles/input_problem17.8optbst.txt) describes an instance of the optimal binary search tree problem. The format of the file is:

  1st line: number specifying the number n of keys
  2nd line: n frequencies as comma-separated integer values

*(Answer: the value of an optimal solution is 2780.)*
