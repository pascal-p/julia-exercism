## Algorithms Specialization - Standford / Coursera
Instructor: [Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~768)  

Julia Programming Implementation.

### C01 - Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
 - [X] [Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer)

The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), and randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).

 - [X] [week 1 - Assignment - Karatsubaâ€™s integer multiplication](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/Algo/01-karatsuba-int-mult/README.md)  
 - [X] [week 2 - Assignment - Counting Inversions](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/Algo/02-counting-inversions/README.md)  
 - [X] [week 3 - Assignment - Quick Sort](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/Algo/03-quick-sort/README.md)  
 - [X] [week 4 - Assignment - Randomized Selection](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/Algo/04-selection/README.md)  

### C02 - Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
 - [ ] [Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures)

The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of breadth-first and depth-first search, connectivity, shortest paths), and their applications (ranging from deduplication to social network analysis).

### C03 - Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming
 - [ ] [Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-greedy)

The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: greedy algorithms (scheduling, minimum spanning trees, clustering, Huffman codes) and dynamic programming (knapsack, sequence alignment, optimal search trees).

  - [ ] TODO

### C04 - Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them
 - [ ] [Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-npcomplete)

The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: shortest paths (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson), NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer, and strategies for coping with computationally intractable problems (analysis of heuristics, local search).
