# Implementing "a variant of the 2-SUM" algorithm 

  **Programming Problem 12.4: 2-SUM problem**  

## Work

  - Test case: This [file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/Algo/12-2-sum/testfiles/problem12.4test.txt) describes an array with 9 integers. For how many target values t in the interval [3,10] are there distinct numbers x,y in the input array such that x+y=t? (Note: ensuring distinctness requires a one-line addition to the algorithm in Section 12.2.2.) (Answer: 8)
  
  - Challenge data set: This [file](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/datasets/problem12.4.txt) contains one million integers, both positive and negative (possibly with repetitions!), with the ith row specifying the ith entry of the input array. For how many target values t in the interval [-10000,10000] are there distinct numbers x,y in the input array such that x+y=t?
