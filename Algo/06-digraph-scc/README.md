# Implementing Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
    
  **Programming Problem 8.10: Computing Strongly Connected Components**  
  using Kosajaru Sharir Algorithm

    
## Work

 - Test case #1: A 9-vertex 11-edge graph [file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/06-digraph-scc/tests/9v_11e_tc.txt). Top 5 SCC sizes: 3,3,3,0,0
 - Test case #2: An 8-vertex 14-edge graph [file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/06-digraph-scc/tests/8v_14e_tc.txt). Top 5 SCC sizes: 3,3,2,0,0
 - Test case #3: An 8-vertex 9-edge graph [file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/06-digraph-scc/tests/8v_9e_tc.txt). Top 5 SCC sizes: 3,3,1,1,0
 - Test case #4: An 8-vertex 11-edge graph [file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/06-digraph-scc/tests/8v_11e_tc.txt). Top 5 SCC sizes: 7,1,0,0,0
 - Test case #5: A 12-vertex 20-edge graph [file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/06-digraph-scc/tests/12v_20e_tc.txt). Top 5 SCC sizes: 6,3,2,1,0
 
 - Challenge data set: This [file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/06-digraph-scc/tests/875714v_5105043e_tc.txt.bz2) describes the adjacency list of a directed graph. Vertices are labeled as positive integers from 1 to 875714.  
   What are the sizes of the biggest five strongly connected components?
