# Huffman Coding

  **Programming Problem 15.1: Huffman Coding**  
  using Heap and Radix-sort + Qs


## Work
  - In this programming problem and the next you'll code up the greedy algorithm from the lectures on Huffman coding.

Challenge data set: This [file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/Algo/15-1-greedy-huffman-coding/testfiles/input_huffman.txt)  
This file describes an instance of the problem. It has the following format:

    [number_of_symbols]
    [weight of symbol #1]
    [weight of symbol #2]
    ...

*For example, the third line of the file is "6852892," indicating that the weight of the second symbol of the alphabet is 6852892*. (*We're using weights instead of frequencies, like in the "A More Complex Example" video.*)

Your task in this problem is to run the Huffman coding algorithm from lecture on this data set. What is the maximum length of a codeword in the resulting Huffman code? *Answer: 9*

Continuing the previous problem, what is the minimum length of a codeword in your Huffman code? *Answer: 19*
