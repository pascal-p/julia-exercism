# Programming Problem 16.2: Sequence Alignment

## Work

  - [This file](https://github.com/pascal-p/julia-exercism/blob/master/Algo/16-2-dp-seq-align/testfiles/input_problem17.8nw.txt) describes an instance of the sequence alignment problem. The format of the file is:

    1st line: length of X and length of Y
    2nd line: gap cost and mismatch cost (the latter is the same for every pair of distinct symbols)
    3rd line: X sequence
    4th line: Y sequence


*(Answer: the NW score is 224.)*
